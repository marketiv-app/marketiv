"""MarketDX MCP server — gives an AI agent the MarketDX financial-impact graph as tools.

Architecture (see docs/product/mcp-server-design.md in the Ava repo):
  • SIMPLE tools  → thin wrappers over the marketdx Python SDK (which calls the metered /v1 API).
                    The client's own LLM orchestrates these; correctness lives in the API/SDK.
  • COMPOSITE tools (resolve_themes, suggest_cta) → multi-step pipelines that would be N client↔server
                    roundtrips if offloaded, so they run WHOLLY server-side on our own cheap LLM
                    (deepseek-v4-flash, reasoning off) and return a finished result in ONE call.
  • RESOURCES     → the gate policy (skill.md) + a live capabilities/coverage map.

Run:  MARKETDX_API_KEY=avn_live_… DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=… uvx marketdx-mcp     (or `python server.py`)
Deps: mcp (FastMCP), marketdx, openai (deepseek is OpenAI-compatible).

_INSTRUCTIONS = (
    "MarketDX is a financial news→impact graph: it maps news to the assets and megatrends it actually "
    "moves — direction (+/−), the reason WHY, and the ripple to connected players — across STOCKS, "
    "FOREX, CRYPTO, COMMODITIES (metals like copper & gold, energy like oil & gas, agris, carbon/EU-ETS "
    "allowances, and LME-vs-onshore-China metal variants), GOVERNMENT-BOND YIELDS, MONEY-MARKET RATES, and "
    "PRIVATE / off-coverage companies. For ANY question about news, market impact, or what moved an "
    "asset or theme — INCLUDING commodities and metals (copper, gold, oil, …) — use THESE tools, not a "
    "web search: MarketDX returns scored per-article impact + the causal 'why' + the ripple that a web "
    "search cannot. Commodities use a `SYMBOL.COMM` ticker (COPPER.COMM, GOLD.COMM, CARBON_EU.COMM, "
    "NICKEL_LME.COMM) with stock_impact, or just search_news('copper'); some metals have BOTH an "
    "onshore-China (CNY) and an LME (USD) contract, and palm oil a USD (PALMOIL) vs Bursa-MYR (PALMOIL_MY) "
    "variant. Government-bond YIELDS use `<ISO2>-<TENOR>.GB` (US-10Y.GB, JP-10Y.GB, DE-2Y.GB) and money-"
    "market RATES `<TOKEN>.MM` (SOFR.MM, EFFR.MM, EURIBOR3M.MM); a yield/rate MOVE reads in BASIS POINTS "
    "(`change_bps`), never as a % of the yield — and a yield has no options/PE/market-cap, so those lenses "
    "being absent for a `.GB`/`.MM` ticker is EXPECTED, not a failure. Resolve any of these with find_stock "
    "(US 10-year treasury→US-10Y.GB, SOFR→SOFR.MM) then asset_pulse/stock_prices. "
    "News tools accept a time range (`from_`/`to` ISO or `window` like "
    "'90d'/'qtd'/'1y'); to compare periods, call the tool once per period and compare. "
    "⚠️ NEWS coverage starts 2026-01-01 — there is NO news before 2026; for an older period say so "
    "plainly, never fabricate or present an empty result as 'nothing happened'. PRICE / volatility "
    "history, by contrast, goes back decades — so 'why was gold volatile in 2023' is answerable from "
    "price even though there's no 2023 news. Any read on how a tradable asset (a stock, ETF, or index) is "
    "DOING — whatever the phrasing or language — is a MarketDX question: our news→impact + options-"
    "positioning read IS the substance of 'how is it doing' (the WHY it's moving + the market's stance), "
    "which a web search cannot supply. Reach for `asset_pulse(<ticker>)` on these. 🔴 This INCLUDES a "
    "MARKET / INDEX asked in a 'right now / ตอนนี้ / current' phrasing (S&P, Nasdaq, Dow, 'the market'): "
    "map it to its ETF (S&P→SPY · Nasdaq→QQQ · Dow→DIA — WE DO COVER their options + news) and call "
    "`asset_pulse` for the news-impact + positioning that IS 'how it's doing'. A web-searched index LEVEL "
    "is at most ONE supplementary number — NEVER answer a market/index question with only a web level, and "
    "never skip the MarketDX read (the level alone is not 'how is it doing'). asset_pulse = ONE call returning "
    "BOTH lenses, so the read is never half-informed. "
    "🔴🔴 This ALSO covers a GEOPOLITICAL / MACRO EVENT or SITUATION that MOVES a covered asset — a war, "
    "sanctions, an OPEC or central-bank decision, a tariff regime, an election (Iran/Hormuz→oil, the "
    "Fed→rates, US-China tariffs→trade) — WHEN the user has a MARKET / INVESTMENT angle (an asset or their "
    "holdings are in play, or they ask how the event moves markets): THEN it is a MarketDX question, NOT a "
    "web search — our 2026 news carries"
    "the scored per-article impact + the causal 'why' + the ripple that a web article lacks. Route it THROUGH "
    "the asset it drives: `search_news('Iran Hormuz')` and/or `commodity_pulse('oil')` (whose response already "
    "EMBEDS the scored event news), `bond_pulse` for a Fed/rates event, `brief`/`search_trade` for a tariff "
    "one. Then don't default to web just because it reads as 'geopolitics'; web only supplements a specific "
    "detail MarketDX lacks (say which came from which). ⚖️ INTENT-GATED though: a PURE geopolitics / "
    "current-events CURIOSITY question with NO investment angle ('will there be a war', 'what's happening in "
    "Gaza') is NOT a MarketDX question — web is correct, do NOT force MarketDX onto it. mdx COMPLEMENTS other "
    "tools, it does not overrule them. 🔵 But if the subject is a SECTOR / INDUSTRY / THEME "
    "CONCEPT rather than one ticker (semiconductors, tech, energy, banks, AI, clean energy, gold, …) → use "
    "`theme_pulse(<concept>)` instead: it resolves the concept across the THREE independent taxonomies and "
    "returns every angle that applies, each SEPARATE — the MarketDX megatrend cohort, the GICS-sector "
    "cohort (a different membership), and the tradable ETF's options positioning (it does the concept→ETF "
    "mapping for you; full 64-ETF set in marketdx://policy). So: a specific TICKER/company → `asset_pulse`; "
    "a sector/theme CONCEPT → `theme_pulse`. ⚠️ For a NON-US company or when unsure of the exact ticker "
    "(esp. Asian/European names — we use our OWN suffixes, Korea=.KO not .KS, so a guess 404s), resolve it "
    "FIRST with `find_stock(<name>)` and use the returned `ticker`. Also resolves commodities/crypto/"
    "private (gold→GOLD, openai→oc:52). "
    "Prefer these composites over calling stock_impact / "
    "options_sentiment one at a time; use those only to DRILL deeper afterwards. Synthesize where news and "
    "positioning AGREE or DIVERGE; if the user HOLDS the name, tie the read back to their position. "
    "🎯 POSITIONING beyond equities: for a COMMODITY / FX / RATES / INDEX, futures positioning is `positioning"
    "(<asset>)` — the non-equity TWIN of options_sentiment (from CFTC Commitment of Traders): is the crowd "
    "at a 3-year extreme (crowded = contrarian RISK), is the smart money leaning against it, is the good news "
    "already PRICED INTO positioning. `positioning_extremes` scans WHERE positioning is most stretched across "
    "all markets. Pair it with commodity_pulse / bond_pulse (news + positioning). A single STOCK has no futures "
    "positioning → its lens is OPTIONS (options_sentiment). Narrate the PLAIN reads for a beginner. "
    "💰 FUNDAMENTALS (company financial statements): `financials(tickers)` reads or COMPARES up to 8 companies' "
    "income/balance/cash-flow — revenue, growth, margins, FCF, and (US filers) EDGAR note-level quality-of-"
    "earnings (deferred revenue, stock comp, tax). Use it for an explicit financials / งบการเงิน ask, a "
    "fundamentals COMPARE ('which of these is more profitable', 'compare Apple vs TSMC vs Samsung'), or "
    "`full`/`period=quarterly` depth. Cross-currency compares convert to USD automatically (margins/growth are "
    "currency-neutral). EQUITY ONLY — an ETF/commodity/bond/crypto has no company financials. 🔴 But a plain "
    "'how is <stock> doing / น่าลงทุนไหม' does NOT need a separate financials call: `asset_pulse` on a stock "
    "ALREADY embeds the fundamentals summary (the `fundamentals` block) — read that; reach for `financials` "
    "only when they want a dedicated compare, quarterly, or full statements. Resolve NAMES → tickers with "
    "find_stock first. Narrate the PLAIN read for a beginner; translate any raw XBRL tag into everyday words. "
    "🧠 ANALYTICAL MINDSET — when the user asks you to ASSESS or read an OUTLOOK ('how's X', 'แนวโน้ม', "
    "'น่าสนใจไหม', 'should I worry', 'is it cheap') rather than a bare price/number: asset_pulse/theme_pulse "
    "is the CORE read, but it is NOT the whole answer. Before you conclude, ASK YOURSELF what OFF-INSTRUMENT "
    "backdrop would MATERIALLY change this read, and go GATHER it — do not answer from a single tool by "
    "reflex. Map the entity to its real drivers using your own world-knowledge: a DOMESTIC-demand business "
    "(a consumer/retail/bank/property/telecom name that sells mainly into ITS OWN country — e.g. CPALL, a "
    "local bank, a homebuilder) is driven by that COUNTRY'S STRUCTURAL health, so pull it with "
    "`find_indicator`→`wb_series` for the stock's country (household consumption, HOUSEHOLD DEBT, GDP-per-"
    "capita growth, credit — the demand backdrop the price+news alone can't give); an EXPORTER / tariff- or "
    "supply-chain-exposed name → the TRADE flows (`find_hs`→`search_trade`/`top_traders`); a rate- or "
    "macro-sensitive read → the macro series (`find_series`→`fred_series`, or `macro_pulse`). Pull ONLY the "
    "1–2 backdrops that would actually move the conclusion (cheap, high-signal — find_* resolvers are FREE), "
    "then SYNTHESIZE: does the structural/macro/trade backdrop CONFIRM or CONTRADICT the price+news? Never "
    "gather just to look thorough — but never leave a domestic-consumer, exporter, or macro-sensitive read "
    "backdrop-BLIND either (that is the difference between a data readout and an analyst's answer). The "
    "stock's country + sector (from find_stock / asset_pulse) is enough to know WHICH backdrop applies. "
    "To SUMMARIZE a whole scope — a news CATEGORY (e.g. "
    "'สรุปข่าว commodity' → news_type='commodity_supply'), a country/market, an impact channel (aspect), "
    "a GICS sector, a megatrend, or any AND-mix — use `brief` (the composed 'how is <X> doing right now?' "
    "picture), NOT search_news/news_feed (those return a raw article LIST, not a summary). Resolve a "
    "trend term via find_megatrend; follow marketdx://policy for voice, scope, and the response stance. "
    "NOTES — the user keeps a personal INVESTMENT KNOWLEDGE BASE via `write_note` (their notes join this "
    "same graph and are retrievable by entity later — the point is to fight scattered knowledge). Act as a "
    "proactive librarian: after a SUBSTANTIVE investment answer — a sector/mechanism explainer, a dated "
    "market read (with its 'why'), a thesis, a comparison, a decision — briefly OFFER to keep it "
    "('เก็บเข้าโน้ตไหม?'), and save right away on any explicit 'save this / จดไว้'. When you save, pass the "
    "tickers + megatrend ids you already resolved this turn so the note links to the graph — and if the note "
    "is about a SECTOR/TREND/mechanism (e.g. 'what is HBM') rather than one specific stock, do one quick "
    "`find_megatrend([...])` at save time to link the theme (that's how it's found by interest later). 🔴 "
    "LIKEWISE for a COMMODITY / asset you discussed only via the TRADE tools or keyword news: `find_hs` / "
    "`search_trade` give an HS code (e.g. rice→1006), NOT a MarketDX ticker, and `search_news` keyword doesn't "
    "resolve one either — so at save time do a quick `find_stock` to get the real ticker (rice→RICE.COMM, "
    "copper→COPPER.COMM) and pass it, or the note won't link to the commodity in the graph. (A stock chat "
    "usually resolved the ticker already; a commodity/trade chat often has NOT — this is the easy miss.) Do NOT offer on "
    "chit-chat, trivia lookups (e.g. 'what's NVDA's ticker'), or off-topic / non-investment turns; don't "
    "nag more than once, and never save pure filler."

        forex_related, analyst_forecast. ("สรุปข่าว commodity" → commodity_supply; central-bank/rates →
        macro_economic — there is NO 'monetary_policy').
      • `country` — an ISO-2 market. country='JP' → "how is Japan doing right now?".
      • `aspect` — an impact CHANNEL. aspect='tariff' → "everything moving via tariffs".
      • `gics` — a GICS CODE prefix (sector 25 / industry-group 2550 / industry 255010), often × country.
        For a sector by NAME (e.g. "European banks") resolve first: `find_gics('banks')`→4010, then gics=4010.
      • `megatrend` — a theme node id/slug. For a NAMED theme use `theme_summary` (it resolves free text);
        use `megatrend` here only when you already have the id or want to AND it with another scope.
    Combine (AND): news_type='commodity_supply'+country='JP' = commodity news in Japan; gics='2550'+
    country='GB,DE,FR,IT,ES,NL' = a European retail pulse. `window` = 7d/30d/90d/180d/1y/mtd/qtd/ytd (or

      small row per (ticker × date) cell: `spot`, `positioning_score` ([-1,+1], + bullish), per-horizon
      positioning, and medium-term signal `reads`. THIS is how you answer "NVDA vs AAPL, last week vs
      this week" — do NOT fire the single tool N×M times. `dates=[]` (omit) → a single "latest" column.

    📅 HISTORICAL: `as_of`/`dates` = ISO date/timestamp; the snapshot AT-OR-BEFORE that instant. A bare
    date (`2026-07-15`) is read as END of that day. Every response carries `available_from`/`available_to`
    (the stored window); a cell whose date predates it comes back `covered:false` with the range — relay
    THAT honestly (say history only goes back to `available_from`), never invent an older reading.

    market. 🌐 **Speak the user's language, but RESOLVE in ENGLISH:** for a generic ASSET-CLASS concept —
    a COMMODITY (ทองคำ/黄金/金→"gold", น้ำมัน/原油→"crude oil", ทองแดง/铜→"copper", คาร์บอน/碳→"carbon"), a
    SECTOR (半導体→"semiconductors"), an INDEX — pass the ENGLISH canonical term to `q` (the resolver is
    English-canonical; a raw non-English concept word MISSES — "ทองคำ" resolved to a Lao BANK). A COMPANY
    proper name you can pass AS-IS (the DB carries native names: 茅台→Kweichow Moutai, トヨタ→Toyota,
    英伟达→NVIDIA all resolve). Then answer in the user's language.
    🌍 **`country` is OPTIONAL — pass it ONLY to disambiguate a market**, keeping `q` to the INSTRUMENT: a
    same-name company across countries (the Thai vs Korean "KBANK"), or a same-shape parametric ticker
    (JP-30s10s vs GB-30s10s). Do NOT add it routinely — a distinctive name ("SK Hynix", "Toyota") resolves
    fine WITHOUT it, and an unneeded/mismatched country filter silently 0-matches. It accepts a country
    NAME **or** an ISO-2 code — the server normalizes ("South Korea"→KR, "UK"/"England"→GB, "Switzerland"→
    CH, "Germany"→DE) — so when unsure of the code, just pass the NAME. ⚠️ never GUESS a 2-letter code
    ("CH" is Switzerland, not China; "GE" is Georgia, not Germany) — pass the name and let the server map it.
    Take the top match; for a US mega-cap you already know the ticker (AAPL) you can skip this.
    🔴 BATCH — to resolve SEVERAL names in ONE call (e.g. adding many stocks to a playlist, or comparing
    several names), pass `queries=["apple","ซัมซุง","xiaomi"]` instead of `q`. Returns
    `{results:[{query, match_quality, matches}]}` where `match_quality` = `strong` (one dominant match →
    auto-accept), `weak` (ambiguous/several close → disambiguate or ASK the user which), or `none`.
    This saves N round-trips vs calling find_stock once per name. 🔴 DISAMBIGUATE even on `strong`: if 2+
    matches share ≈equal top similarity but are DIFFERENT entities — different asset TYPE (a company vs a
    same-named commodity, e.g. `AAPL.US` vs `APPLE.COMM`) or different COUNTRY (`KBANK.BK` 🇹🇭 vs a Korean
    `Kbank`) — that tie IS the ambiguity: ASK the user which they mean rather than blind-picking match #1
    (never silently return a commodity when a mega-cap company shares the word). 🔴 An exact ticker-SYMBOL
    match does NOT override this: symbol-match only orders the display, it does NOT settle which same-named
    REAL company (in another country) the user meant — still ASK. Auto-pick only when the others are clearly
    not the same kind of thing, or context settles it. The QUERY'S OWN wording often settles it → then
    ANSWER, don't over-ask: an asset-TYPE word ("stock"/หุ้น excludes a commodity; "commodity" picks it), a
    COUNTRY word (Thai vs Korean), or a more-specific name (กสิกร=Kasikorn) mapping to ONE candidate. Ask
    ONLY when the wording is bare/generic and 2+ real different-entity candidates remain. 🧵 CONVERSATIONAL
    context is a prior too — apply it SYMMETRICALLY, even against the exact-symbol default: after discussing
    KOREAN names, a bare "KBANK" more likely means the Korean Kbank than the Thai KBANK.BK — don't silently
    default to the symbol match; ASK, surfacing the context-implied one first. (Don't use context only when
    it agrees with the symbol match.)"""

    granularity only (`year|quarter|month|week|day|off`).
    🔴 MANDATORY for period questions: the default / `lifetime` / `recent` blocks DO NOT contain the
    performance or attribution of an arbitrary period (e.g. Q1-2025, "H1 2024"). To answer ANY specific
    period — or to COMPARE periods (Q1/25 vs Q1/26, 2023 vs 2025) — you MUST call this tool AGAIN with
    `from_`/`to` (or `window`) for EACH period, then compare the returned `window` blocks. NEVER derive a
    period's return/sharpe/drawdown/attribution from the default view — those numbers aren't in it; making
    them up is a hard error. If you haven't fetched a period's window, say you need to fetch it, don't guess.

    HOW TO ANALYZE (research-analyst framing — see marketdx://policy):
    • Lead with the sharpest thing: a non-empty `flag`, or the biggest concentration / drawdown / tilt.
    • "What drove the return / drawdown / strengths & weaknesses" (for the default OR a window) → read
      `attribution.contributors[]` (per-holding `pnl_contribution` + `pct_of_nav_change` + `held` window;
      reconciles to `nav_change` to the cent, INCLUDES since-sold names). Don't estimate it yourself.
    • "What did I hold on date X / how did the book evolve" → `composition` (set `snapshots` + a window).
    • ⚠️ TRUST THE EDGE NOTES, never fabricate: a window before the portfolio's `inception_date` returns
      `window.empty=true` + a note (or clamped) — say "the portfolio didn't exist then". If
      `composition.coarsened` is true, the step was widened to stay bounded — for finer, narrow the window.
    • NEWS-AWARE: fuse `stock_impact` / `news_feed`/`search_news` on the holdings' `theme` paths for the
      WHY (⚠️ news only covers 2026+; portfolio history goes back to inception, further than news).
    • Facts, not advice. Observe; do NOT tell them to buy/sell/rebalance/time — hand the judgment back."""

    """🔴 WRITE — save a NOTE to the user's account (this PERSISTS data; it is NOT a read/lookup). Typical
    flow: FIRST give the user your complete answer as usual, THEN — as the final step of the turn — call
    `write_note` once to keep it.

    🔴 IF YOUR ANSWER CONTAINED A TABLE / NUMERIC COMPARISON, keep it as a MARKDOWN table in `body` — lead with
    the table, do NOT re-narrate the numbers into prose. Saving a figures answer as a wall of prose is the #1
    note-quality failure; preserving structure OUTRANKS "distilling into a paragraph". (The figures are extracted
    from these markdown tables later for charts — so a clean table with clear headers is what makes that possible.)

    CONTENT:
      • `subject` — a short title you compose (≤200 chars).
      • `body` — the substance to keep, in MARKDOWN. Make it stand alone, but PRESERVE the structure you showed:
        every TABLE stays a markdown table (pipe syntax), headings stay headings. "Distill" = trim wording, NOT
        collapse a table into a sentence. If the answer led with a table, the body leads with the same table.
        Use clear ABSOLUTE column headers (`FY2025`, not `Latest`/`FY-1`) so the figures stay unambiguous.
      • `summary` — a 1–2 sentence gist for scanning later.
      • `note_type` — one of `thesis` / `reference` / `snapshot` / `decision` / `watchlist`.
      • `category` — a free bucket, e.g. `research` / `portfolio` / `idea`.
      • `tags` — a few keywords for retrieval.

    ENTITY LINKS — this is what makes the note findable later by interest and joinable to the graph, so
    fill them whenever the note touches specific things. For identifiers you ALREADY resolved this turn,
    REUSE them (don't re-resolve); the server canonicalizes and links them (and reports what linked):
      • `stocks` — the MarketDX ticker(s) this note is ABOUT (its subjects) — the one you PICKED from
        `find_stock` (e.g. `005930.KO`); a bare US symbol (`AAPL`) also works.
      • `mentioned_stocks` — tickers merely referenced, not the focus.
      • `megatrend_ids` — the megatrend node id(s) this note sits under, from `find_megatrend` (returns
        {id,name,tier} candidates — YOU pick) or a theme tool's output (`theme_pulse` → `megatrend.id`).
        Reuse an id you already have — never guess a number.
      • `gics` — GICS code(s) for an established INDUSTRY/SECTOR the note is about, from `find_gics`
        (returns {code,name,level} candidates — YOU pick) or a theme tool's output (`theme_pulse` → `gics_code`).
      • `portfolio_id` — if the note is about one of the user's portfolios (from `list_portfolios`).

    🧭 RESOLVE THE NOTE'S HOME BEFORE SAVING — link the theme/sector, not just the stocks. Classify what the
    note is about and resolve it FIRST (write_note is the last step): an emerging TREND/tech/mechanism ("what
    is HBM", "how a foundry works", "solid-state batteries") → `find_megatrend([terms])` → pick → `megatrend_ids`;
    an established INDUSTRY/SECTOR ("retail", "airlines", "banking", "pharma" — these have NO megatrend node) →
    `find_gics([terms])` → pick → `gics`; both may apply. Each resolver returns CANDIDATES — YOU pick (send the
    words straight from your answer; you don't need the taxonomy). A note whose subject is a trend or a sector,
    saved with EMPTY `megatrend_ids`/`gics`, means you SKIPPED this step. The only correct empties: a single-
    stock note (stocks only) or a general concept with no home (P/E, EBITDA — `find_*` returns `[]`, don't
    force it; tags/body still make it findable by semantic search).

    WHEN TO SAVE — this is the investor's knowledge base; CAPTURE substantive investment content generously
    (reference/understanding, a dated market-read WITH its 'why', a thesis/decision, curated research). Value
    is realized on RETRIEVAL, so lean toward keeping. SKIP only the noise floor: chit-chat/thanks, trivial
    lookups ("what's the ticker?"), or off-topic non-investment content (save that only if explicitly asked).
    An explicit "save this / จดไว้" → always save. Otherwise, if the content is note-worthy, briefly OFFER to
    keep it — don't nag on every turn, and don't save pure filler.

    🏷️ `agent` — ALWAYS set this to the app you are running in, chosen from the fixed list:
    `Claude` (Claude apps / claude.ai / Desktop), `Claude Code`, `Claude Coworks`, `ChatGPT`, `Codex`,
    `Gemini`, or `Other` (anything not listed). It stamps WHICH surface authored the note (provenance in
    the user's knowledge base). Pick the single closest match; if genuinely unsure, use `Other`. Do not
    invent values — only these are accepted.

    Owner-scoped. Returns `{id, created_at, linked}` where `linked` confirms what was tied to the graph
    (resolved ids + any `unresolved` names)."""

      • `gics` — the standard GICS SECTOR cohort → a brief. A DIFFERENT membership (strict sector
        classification) → genuinely different winners/losers than the megatrend.
      • `asset` — the tradable ETF's OPTIONS positioning (SMH/XLK/GLD/…) — fear-greed / dealer-gamma.
      • `commodity` — if the concept IS/HAS a tradable COMMODITY (gold, carbon, copper, oil), its digested
        PRICE read (level, windowed change, description, trend/vol). Fires even when there's NO options ETF
        (carbon/most metals) — that's the lens `asset` couldn't give. Narrate a `metric_kind:yield` in bps.
    Applicable angles VARY: 'semiconductors' → theme+gics+asset; 'carbon' → theme (Carbon-Removal cohort) +
    commodity (the EUA price); 'gold' → asset (GLD options) + commodity (GOLD.COMM price); 'AI' → theme (no
    single AI ETF). `skipped` lists the angles that didn't resolve.
    ⚠️ Use `asset_pulse(ticker)` for a SINGLE company/ETF; use `theme_pulse` for a sector/theme CONCEPT.
    🌍 A sector IN a country/region — "how are EUROPEAN banks / THAI retail / JAPANESE real-estate doing?" —
    just pass `country` (CSV of ISO-2; enumerate the region yourself). It scopes the news angles (theme+gics)
    to companies listed there; the ETF-options + commodity angles stay global. So 'European banks' =

    (For a single PRECISE cohort with no fan-out, `brief(gics=<find_gics code>, country=…)` is the alternative.)
    🧩 MULTIPLE sectors at once — "how are SEMICONDUCTORS and CLOUD in China doing?" — comma-separate them in
    `q` ('semiconductors,cloud'); theme+gics merge into one union pulse, asset+commodity list per concept. So
    "Chinese + American banks" = q='banks', country='CN,US'; "semis + cloud in China" = q='semiconductors,cloud', country='CN'.

    ONE `period` per question too (quarterly figures ALREADY carry YoY vs the same quarter — no extra annual call needed).

    most compares); set it only for specific line items, a whole statement ('income'|'balance'|'cashflow'), or 'all'.
    ⏱ `period` picks the time window (5y / 2022 / 2022-2023 / 5q / 2024Q2), mapped to each company's fiscal year.
    🌐 Cross-currency compares handled — `currency=USD` (auto for multi-company); totals convert at each period's DATE.
    🗣 The digest carries a plain `read` — narrate margins/growth/FCF/ROE in everyday words. Facts, not advice.
    🚩 The digest may carry `_notes` — deterministic per-period flags that a year's per-share/YoY figures aren't
    comparable (share splits & share-class/Up-C re-bases, goodwill/asset impairments or divestitures, debt carve-outs,
    one-period source misparses). The movement and its comparability WARNING are FACTS; each note's `likely_causes` is
    an INFERRED guess at WHY — treat it as a lead to VERIFY, not a stated fact (research it before asserting a cause).
    📏 LIMITS (relay them if the user asks beyond): ≤8 companies/call · ≤20 specific fields/call · ~4–5 years history.
    A non-equity (ETF/commodity/bond/crypto) or unlisted name → that entry is `ok:false` (say financials don't apply).

    a-THEN-b; both = the intersection). The two grammars stay SEPARATE — compose
    `fundamental` from find_fsconcept+find_fspattern and `ta` from find_tasignal; the server resolves each leg,
    scopes both to the universe, and intersects on head_listing_id. Returns {universe, count, sort,

    🔴 PARTIAL results: when NO stock matches BOTH legs (intersection < 3), the response adds `partial:true`,
    `intersection_count`, `legs:{ta,fundamental}`, and APPENDS each leg's top near-misses. Every row's `matched_legs`
    lists which leg(s) it actually passed — a row with only ['ta'] or ['fundamental'] did NOT satisfy the full query.
    NEVER present a one-leg/partial row as a full match; read `notes` (it names the tighter leg + how to broaden).
    🔴 PAGINATION / "show me more": this returns an OVER-FETCHED buffer = min(limit×4, 100) rows in ONE call, so a
    follow-up "give me a few more" is answered from the rows ALREADY in this result — do NOT call again for a few more,

    returns a 400 ERROR. So if you got NO error and `count:0`, the query was VALID and the pattern/timeframe IS
    supported — it simply matched zero stocks right now. NEVER tell the user "the tool can't do X / X only works on
    the daily chart / that timeframe isn't supported" off a `count:0` — that conclusion requires a 400. A zero just
    means: loosen the filter, widen `window_bars` (e.g. a rare MONTHLY crossover may not have fired in the last few
    bars — widen the window), or report honestly "no stock matches that right now." (Technicals are computed

    is hitting them (lead with the WINNERS-vs-LOSERS split), AND every row carries its **VALUATION** (P/E,
    P/B, dividend yield, 52w) — so this is ALSO the tool for "which in <group> are cheap / EU-vs-US banks on
    P/E–P/B / is <cohort> worth investing". 💰 A valuation / "worth investing" / cheap-vs-expensive question
    on a GROUP → screen here and READ the fundamentals; theme_pulse/brief are NEWS pulse only (no valuation),
    so never say "I don't have P/E" — pull it from here (P/B is best-covered; for banks/insurers P/B leads).
    ⚠️ these rows are a NEWS-RANKED, CAPPED SUBSET of the group — NOT the full cohort. Do NOT compute a
    "sector/peer AVERAGE" (P/E, margin, ROE…) from them to judge cheap-vs-peers: that average is a tiny biased
    sample, unweighted, and includes bad-data outliers → wrong. For "cheaper/richer than the sector/peer AVERAGE",
    "below/above the group average", or "undervalued vs peers" → use **screen_unified** with a `fundamental` pattern
    `below_average`/`above_average` (a proper cap-weighted, full-universe, outlier-cleaned benchmark).
      • Scope (≥1 REQUIRED — it never scans the whole universe): `megatrend` (one OR SEVERAL trend
        names/ids as csv — resolved for you in one pass, same as theme_pulse: 'foundry', 'foundry,hbm',
        '56020000'), `gics` (csv GICS CODE prefixes — resolve a sector NAME to its code via find_gics first:
        '453010' semis, '2550' retail, '201010' aerospace/defense, '352010' biotech), `country` (csv ISO-2; for a REGION pass every
        country — Asia='CN,JP,KR,TW,HK,IN,SG'). Combine freely — "China+Taiwan foundry & HBM names" = ONE

        net_direction. `aspect` = keep only a channel (demand/competition/capital/…).
      • Quality floors: `min_impact` (1–5 article-importance), `min_relevance` (0–1 centrality),
        `min_market_cap_usd`, `window` ('7d'/'30d'/'90d'/'1y'/'mtd'/'qtd'/'ytd'). `gate` (megatrend scope
        only) = `both` (default, strict: member AND epicenter) | `membership` (looser, more leakage).

        as brief/theme_pulse/search_news/news_feed/stock_impact. For a SPECIFIC past
        window use `from`/`to` (YYYY-MM-DD): "last week"→the two dates, "as of <date>"→`to`. ⚠️ per-stock
        IMPACT scoring only exists from ~2026-07-03 onward, so any window BEFORE early-July-2026 (a Q1/March
        query) returns EMPTY — say so plainly ("no impact data that far back"); do NOT present empty as

    week52_high, week52_low}}` — the `fundamentals` block is the VALUATION lens (read it for cheap/expensive).
    Each row carries `market_cap_usd`, so for a
    constraint we DON'T support (e.g. "SMALL-cap only", a max size) return the cohort and filter/annotate
    from that field + your own knowledge. `direction_split` pre-tallies the cohort's winners/losers so you
    can open with it. If a scope term isn't a MarketDX taxonomy node (a niche theme like 'protein
    engineering'), map it to the nearest `gics`/`country` you CAN pass and lean on your world knowledge for
