  <b>The financial impact graph.</b><br>
  A structured, <i>explained</i> map of what financial news is about and who it touches — the <i>why</i>
  (causal channel), the story's lean, and the <i>ripple</i> — across stocks, commodities, FX, crypto,
  <b>and private companies</b>. A research &amp; context layer, not a trading signal.

Most feeds give you a headline and a sentiment score. MarketIV labels **every affected entity on every
event, across many dimensions** — 10 causal channels (demand · supply · regulation · tariff · competition
· pricing · capital · technology · geopolitics · monetary), per-entity direction & relevance, epicenter
**and** ripple, across **five asset classes including non-listed companies** ticker feeds structurally
can't see. It's a layer for **understanding and structuring** the news flow — a research, screening and
feature input — **not** a predictive price signal (news is largely priced in by the time it's public).

## What a signal looks like

One headline → every entity it touches, each labeled with the **lean** (+/−) and the **why**. Take
*"AI-driven memory shortage forces Apple, Samsung, Microsoft… to raise device prices"*:

| entity | | lean | why (aspect) |
|--------|---|:---:|---|
| Apple | stock | **−** | pricing — chip costs squeeze margins |
| Microsoft | stock | **−** | pricing |
| Nintendo | stock | **−** | pricing |
| Samsung | stock | **+** | demand — it *makes* the memory |

Same event, opposite outcomes — because the **why** is labeled, not just a sentiment score. And it spans
**five asset classes including private companies** (OpenAI, Anthropic, …) that ticker feeds structurally
can't see, plus the **ripple** into non-obvious names.
