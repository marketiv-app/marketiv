"""Controlled vocabularies — **type-sugar only**, never a runtime gate.

These `Literal` types give your editor/`mypy` autocomplete + typo-flagging at
author-time (before any network call). At *runtime* the SDK does NOT validate
against them — it passes your value straight to the API, which is the single
source of truth (`GET /v1/enums`) and returns a clear ``400`` (→
:class:`marketiv.errors.BadRequestError`) if the value is wrong.

Why not hard-validate here? Forward-compatibility. When the API gains a new
value (e.g. the ``monetary`` / ``tariff`` aspects added mid-2026), an old SDK
that validated against a frozen copy would *reject a value the API accepts* —
reintroducing drift. A stale `Literal` only shows an ignorable editor hint; it
never blocks execution. So: hints catch typos, the API stays authoritative.

The same vocabularies are mirrored (offline) in the sample dataset's
``datapackage.json``; a root CI test asserts SDK ≡ datapackage ≡ ``/v1/enums``.
